# Model Card

For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details

Random Forest is used with default hyperparameters.

## Intended Use

The model should be used to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50k/year based on census data.

## Training Data

Train data is 75% of the dataset.

## Evaluation Data

Evaluation data is the other 25% of the dataset.

## Metrics

Metrics used and their results after training and testing the model:  
Precision: 0.7598  
Recall: 0.6111  
F1: 0.6774

## Ethical Considerations

The model could potentially reinforce some societal bias because some demographic features can be correlated with race, gender, etc.

## Caveats and Recommendations

It is recommended to explore feature importance in further depth to understand which variables contribute most to the predictions.

The modelâ€™s performance should be periodically reassessed, and the model should be updated with new data to maintain its accuracy and relevance.
